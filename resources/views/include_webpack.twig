        Add webpack compilation output scripts & styles
        This will render the script/style tags for entries that have been enabled prior to this point

        If the webpack-dev-server is active. Instead of local paths, we point them to the dev-server. This also enables HMR
        This will automatically include ALL scripts & styles, but still depends on providers to get executed

        The line WEBPACK_HERE_PLEASE will be replaced with all the dev-server script and styles. This is being done by the middleware
        @todo Change so this does not use a middleware anymore. Preferably combining it with the render funcs
